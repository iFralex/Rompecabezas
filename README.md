# Rompecabezas
This game was commissioned to me on Fiverr in 2021 by a person who wanted to sell this game to schools.

This repository hosts a Unity-based educational video game aimed at teaching students the proper way to write letters in Spanish. This technical description will provide an in-depth overview of the project's key components and functionalities.

# Technical Overview:
## 1. Unity Engine:

The game is developed using the Unity game engine, which provides a robust platform for creating interactive 2D and 3D applications.
The latest tested version for which the game works totally is: Unity 2021-3-4f1

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics:

The core gameplay revolves around arranging various letter components (e.g., body, signature, date) in the correct order. These elements are presented on the right side of the screen, and students must drag and drop them onto the letter template on the left, ensuring the correct sequence.

To aid students who may encounter difficulties, the game includes a hint system. Students can access hints via a dedicated button, which offers guidance on the correct order of the letter components.

## 3. Educational Focus:
The primary educational goal of the game is to teach students the proper format for writing letters in Spanish. By engaging in interactive gameplay, students can reinforce their understanding of letter structure and composition.

# C# Scripts
A Unity project has many files in addition to scripts that are usually not managed by the developer. If **you are only interested in seeing my work**, namely the C# scripts I wrote, go directly to the [assets folder](https://github.com/iFralex/Rompecabezas/tree/main/Assets) and open the C# files.

Unfortunately, the project was not developed with the intention of publication, so the file names, variables, and functions are in Italian, and no scripts are commented or written to facilitate reading by others.

Keep in mind that I programmed this video game when I was 15 years old, so you can imagine that the code is not perfect or optimized to the best, but it still works perfectly.
